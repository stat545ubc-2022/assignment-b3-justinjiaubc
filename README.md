A description of your app. This app is to explore the products available in BC liquor stores. I add 6 new features:

#1. Use the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table

#2.place plot and table in separate tabs

#3.Allow the user to download your table as a .csv file

#4.Show the number of results found whenever the filters change

#5.Allow the user to search for multiple entries simultaneously

#6.Add an image to the UI

I use the bc liquor dataset https://deanattali.com/files/bcl-data.csv
